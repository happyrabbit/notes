    "In a common situation you might be sent a file, or you might download a file from the internet that comes with code known as a `checksum` or a `hash`. Hashing programs generate a unique code based on the contents of a file. People distribute hashes with files so that we can be sure that the file we think we’ve downloaded is the genuine file. **One way we can prevent malicious individuals from sending us harmful files is to check to make sure the computed hash matches the provided hash.** There are a few commonly used file hashes but we’ll talk about two called MD5 and SHA-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since hashes are generated based on file contents, then two identical files should have the same hash. Let’s test this my making a copy of states.txt.\n",

    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we expected they’re the same! We can compute the SHA-1 hash using the `shasum` command:\n",

    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, both copies produce the same hash. Let’s make a change to one of the files, just to illustrate the fact that the hash changes if file contents are different:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "head -n 5 small_copy.txt > small_copy.txt\n",

    "\n",
    "The `md5` and `shasum` commands use different algorithms to create codes (called hashes or checksums) that are unique to the contents of a file.\n",
    "These hashes can be used to ensure that a file is genuine.\n"
