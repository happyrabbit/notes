    "One easy way to create a file is using output redirection. Output redirection stores text that would be normally printed to the command line in a text file. You can use output redirection by typing the greater-than sign (>) at the end of a command followed by the name of the new file that will contain the output from the proceeding command. Let’s try an example using echo:\n",
    "\n",
    "`echo \"I am in the file.\" > archive.html`   \n",
    "`cat archive.html`  \n",
    "<pre>## I am in the file.</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "ou can also append text to the end of a file using two greater-than signs (>>). Let’s try this feature out:\n",
    "\n",
    "`echo \"I have been appended.\" >> archive.html `  \n",
    "`cat archive.html ` \n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "## I am in the file.\n",
    "## I have been appended.\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately I have unintentionally overwritten what was already contained in archive.html. There’s no undo button in Unix so I’ll have to live with this mistake. Luckly, I am using Github so that I can recover. This is the first of several lessons demonstrating the damage that you should try to avoid inflicting with Unix. Make sure to take extra care when executing commands that can modify or delete a file, a typo in the command can be potentially devastating. Thankfully there are a few strategies for protecting yourself from mistakes, including managing permissions for files, and tracking versions of your files with Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we should discuss how to edit text files. There are several file editors that are available for your terminal including `vim` and `emacs`. Entire books have been written about how to use both of these text editors, and if you’re interested in one of them you should look for resources online about how to use them. The one text editor we will discuss using is called nano. Just like less, nano uses your entire terminal window. Let’s edit todo.txt using `nano`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`nano archive.html`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve started `nano` you can start editing the text file. The top line of the `nano` editor shows the file you’re currently working on, and the bottom two lines show a few commands that you can use in nano. **The carrot character (^) represents the Control key on your keyboard**, so you can for example type `Control + O` in order to save the changes you’ve made to the text file, or `Control + X` in order to exit `nano` and go back to the prompt.\n",

I highly recommend moving files or folders to a designated trash folder and then deleting them the way you would normally delete files and folders outside of the command line (The path to the Trash Bin is **`~/.Trash`** on Mac and **`~/.local/share/Trash`** on Ubuntu).
