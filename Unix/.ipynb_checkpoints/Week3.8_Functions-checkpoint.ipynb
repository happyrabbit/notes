    "## Writing a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a small piece of code that has a name. Writing functions allows us to re-use the same code multiple times across programs. Functions have the the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "function [name of function]{  \n",
    "  # code here\n",
    "}\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s open up a new file called `hello.sh` so we can write our first simple function.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "# File: hello.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "function hello {\n",
    "  echo \"Hello\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "hello\n",
    "hello\n",
    "hello\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions share lots of their behavior with individual bash scripts including how they handle arguments. The usual bash script arguments like $1, $2, and $@ all work within a function, which allows you to specify function arguments. Let's create a slightly modified version of `hello.sh` which we'll call `ntmy.sh`:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "# File: ntmy.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "function ntmy{\n",
    "  echo \"Nice to meet you $1\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the file above notice that we're not using the ntmy function after we've defined it. That is because we're going to start using the function as command line program. So far we’ve been using the syntax of `bash [name of script]` in order to execute the contents of a script. Now we’re going to start using the source command, which allows us to use function definitions in bash scripts as command line commands. Let’s use source with this file so that we can then use the ntmy command:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "source ntmy.sh\n",
    "ntmy Hui\n",
    "## Nice to meet you Hui\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "And just like that you’ve created your very own command! Once you close your current shell you’ll lose access to the ntmy command, but in the next section we’ll discuss how to set up your own commands so that you always have access to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a more complicated function. Imagine that we wanted to added up a sequence of numbers from the command line, but we had no way of knowing how many numbers would be in the sequence. We need the following steps to accomplish this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. capture a list of arguments which can have variable length\n",
    "2. iterate through that list so we could add up each element\n",
    "3. store the cumulative sum of the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this by using `$@` variable, a `FOR` loop, and variable where we can store the sum. We save the program in a file named `addseq.sh`:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "# File: addseq.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "function addseq {\n",
    "  sum=0\n",
    "  \n",
    "  for element in $@\n",
    "  do\n",
    "    let sum=sum+$element\n",
    "  done\n",
    "  \n",
    "  echo $sum\n",
    "}\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above program, the `$@` indicates arguments we provide to `addseq`."

    "## Getting values from functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are used for two primary purposes: _computing values_ and _side effects_. In the `addseq` command in the previous section we provide the command with a sequence of numbers and then the command provides us with the sum of the sequence which is a value that we are interested in. In this case we can see that `addseq` has computed a value based on a few input values. Many other commands, like `pwd`, return a value without affecting the state of the file on our computer. There are however functions like `mv` or `cpwhich` move and copy files on our computer. A side effect occurs whenever a function creates or changes files on our computer. These commands don't print any value if they succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll open write functions in order to calculate some value, and it's important to understand how to store the result of a function in a variable so that it can be used later. Let's source `addseq.sh` and run it:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "source addseq.sh\n",
    "addseq 1 2 3 4\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look back at the code for `addseq.sh`, we can see that we created a variable in the function called `sum`. When you create variables in functions those variables becaome globally accessible, meaning that even after the program is finished that variable retains its value in your shell. We can easily verify this by echoing the value of sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "echo $sum\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is problematic because it changes the values of variables that we might be using in our shell. For example if we were storing some other important value in a variable called `sum` we would destory that value by accident by running `addseq`. In order to avoid this problem, it's important to to use local keyword when assigning variables within a function. The local keyword ensures that variables outside of our function are not overwritten by our function. Let's create a new version of `addseq` called `addseq2` which used `local` when assigning variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "source addseq2.sh\n",
    "addseq2 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15\n",
    "\n",
    "echo $sum\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `local` within our function the value of `sum` is preserved (which is 10 from previous call on `addseq`)!  "
