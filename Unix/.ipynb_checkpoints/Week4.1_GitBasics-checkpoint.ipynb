    "## What are Git and GitHub?\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a command line program which allows you to track versions of any code or plain text documents that you create. Like the \"track changes\" festure of a word processor, Git keeps track of who made particular changes, the time and date of those changes, and where the changes were made. If a critical file gets deleted by accident, or if you make a breaking change to your code and you want to try to figure out where the breaking change was made, you can use Git to restore the deleted file or find the new bug in your program. Git organizes groups of files that you're tracking into a **repository**, which is just a directory where all of the changes to files in that directory are tracked. Git also help you collaborate with others when you're writing software.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub is a website that procides remote Git repositories. A remote repository is just a Git repository that you're able to access over an internet connection. GitHub allows you to create public remote repositories for free, and anyone can see your code in these public repositories. You can pay for private repository. You can work with friends on code and GitHub can help you sync changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s create our first Git repository. First we need to create a directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "mkdir my-git-repo\n",
    "cd my-git-repo/\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "To start tracking files with Git in a directory enter `git init` into the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "git init\n",
    "## Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/happyrabbit/my-git-repo/.git/\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve just created your first repository! Now let’s create a file and start tracking it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "echo \"This is Hui's git repo : )\" > readme.txt\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve created a file in this Git repository, let’s use `git status` to see what’s going on in this repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "git status\n",
    "\n",
    "## On branch master\n",
    "##\n",
    "## Initial commit\n",
    "##\n",
    "## Untracked files:\n",

    "##\treadme.txt\n",
    "##\n",
    "##nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see `readme.txt` is listed as an untracked file. In order to let Git know that you want to track this file we need to use git add with the name of the file that we want to track. Let’s start tracking readme.txt:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "git add readme.txt\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Git now knows to track any changes to `readme.txt`. Let’s see how the status of the repository has changed:\n",
    "\n",

    "##\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is now tracking `readme.txt`, or in Git-specific language `readme.txt` is now **staged**. Between the parentheses in the message above you can see that git status is giving us a tip about how to unstage (or un-track) this file, which we could do with git rm --cached readme.txt. Let’s unstage this file just to see what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",

    "git add readme.txt\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that Git is tracking `readme.txt` we need to create a milestone to indicate the changes that we made to `readme.txt`. In this case, the changes that we made were creating the file in the first place! This milestone is called a **commit in Git**. A commit logs the content of all of the currently staged files. Right now we only have readme.txt staged so let’s commit the creation of this file. When making a Git commit, we need to write a commit message which is specified after the -m flag. The message should briefly describe what changes you’ve made since the last commit.\n",
