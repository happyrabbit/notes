    "## Escaping, Anchors, Odds and Ends\n",
    "\n",
    "How to search for certain punctuation marks in text considering that those same symbols are used as metacharacters? For example, how would you find a plus sign (`+`) in a line of text since the plus sign is also a metacharacter? The answer is simply using a backslash (\\) before the plus sign in a regex, in order to “escape” the metacharacter functionality. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "egrep \"\\+\" small.txt\n",
    "## tragedy + time = humor\n",
    "egrep \"\\.\" small.txt\n",
    "## http://www.jhsph.edu/\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three more metacharacters that we should discuss, and two of them come as a pair: \n",
    "\n",
    "- the caret (`^`), which represents the start of a line\n",
    "- the dollar sign (`$`) which represents the end of line\n",
    "\n",
    "> These “anchor characters” only match the beginning and ends of lines when coupled with other regular expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following command will search for all strings that begin with “A” :\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "egrep \"^A\" small.txt\n",
    "## ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a mnemonic that I love for remembering which metacharacter to use for each anchor: \n",
    "\n",
    "> “First you get the power, then you get the money.” \n",
    "\n",
    "The caret character is used for exponentiation in many programming languages, so “power” (^) is used for the beginning of a line and “money” ($) is used for the end of a line. : )\n",
    "\n",
    "## pipe character \"`|`\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- “or” metacharacter (`|`), which is also called the “**pipe**” character. This metacharacter allows you to match either the regex on the right or on the left side of the pipe. Let’s take a look at a small example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "egrep \"A|bc\" small.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "## abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n",
    "## ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n",
    "## abc\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use multiple pipe characters to, for example, search for lines that contain the words for all of the cardinal directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "egrep \"North|South|East|West\" states.txt\n",
    "## North Carolina\n",
    "## North Dakota\n",
    "## South Carolina\n",
    "## South Dakota\n",
    "## West Virginia\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Just two more notes on grep: you can display the line number that a match occurs on using the -n flag:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "egrep -n \"t$\" states.txt\n",
    "## 7:Connecticut\n",
    "## 45:Vermont\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "And you can also grep multiple files at once by providing multiple file arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "egrep \"New\" states.txt canada.txt\n",
    "## states.txt:New Hampshire\n",
    "## states.txt:New Jersey\n",
    "## states.txt:New Mexico\n",
    "## states.txt:New York\n",
    "## canada.txt:Newfoundland and Labrador\n",
    "## canada.txt:New Brunswick\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have the power to do some pretty complicated string searching using regular expressions! Imagine you wanted to search for all strings that begin with a vowel and end with character {a, b, c}:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "egrep \"^[aeiou]{1}.+[a-c]{1}$\" small.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "## aa bb cc\n",
