    "# Writing Programs\n",
    "## The Unix Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps there are some design patterns that you've been noticing since started talking about Unix tools, and now we're going to discuss them explicitly. Unix tools were designed alone a set of guidelines which are best summarized by [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson)'s idea that each Unix program should do one thing well. Following this rule when writing functions and programs accomplished several goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limiting a program to only doing one thing reduces the length of the program, and the shorter a program is the easier it is to fix if it contains bugs or if it needs to be revised.\n",
    "- Writing short programs also helps the users of your code understand what's going on in your code in the event that they need to read your code. \n",
    "- People will be able to understand the inputs, outputs, and side effects of your program more easily without reading the source code of your program.\n",
    "- Using small programs to write a new program will increase the likelihood that the new program will also be small. **Composability** is the concept of stinging small programs together together to create a new program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of composability in Unix is best illustrated by the use of the pipe operator (`|`) for creating pipelines of programs. When you're considering what inputs your program is going to have and what your program is going to print to the console you should consider whether or not your program might be used in a pipeline, and you should organize your program accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have talked about functions that compute values and functions that produce side effects. You should notice that the side effect functions like `mv` and `cp` do not print any text to the console if they are successful. The concept of **quietness** is another important part of the Unix philosophy. Quietness in this case means that a function should not print to the console unless it is necessary, wither to inform the user of a value (`pwd`), to display the result of a computation (`bc`), or to warn the user that an error has occured.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making Programs Executable\n",
    "\n",
    "Let't take a detailed look at some of the code files in our current working directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "ls -l | head -n 3\n",
    "\n",
    "## total 192\n",

    "## -rw-r--r--@ 1 happyrabbit  staff  130 Nov 16 09:34 addseq2.sh\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The left column of this table contains a series of individual characters and dashes. The first hyphen (`-`) signifies that each of the entries in this list are files. If any of them where directories then instead of a hyphen there would be a `d`. Excluding the first hyphen we have the following string: `rw-r--r--`. This string reflects the **permissions** that are set up for this file. There are three permissions that we can grant: the ability to **read** the file (`r`), **write** to or edit the file (`w`), or **execute** the file (`x`) as a program. These three permissions can be granted on three different levels of access which correspond to each of the three sets of rwx in the permissions string: the owner of the file, the group that the file belongs to, and everyone other than the owner and the members of a group. Since you created the file you are the owner of the file, and you can set the permissions for files that you own using the `chmod` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "`chmod` command takes two arguments. The first argument is a string which specifies how we're going to change permissions for a file, and the second argument is the path to the file. The first argument has to be composed in a very specific way. First we can specify which set of users we're going to change permission for: \n",

    "|`o`|\tEveryone else|\n",
    "|`a`|\tEveryone above|\n",
    "\n",
    "We then need to specify whether we're going to add, remove, or set the permission:\n",

    "## Environmental Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re one step away from being able to use our scripts and functions as shell commands, but first we need to learn about environmental variables. An **environmental variable** is a variable that Bash creates where data about your current computing environment is stored. **Environmental variable names use all capitalized letters**. Let’s look at the values for some of these variables. The HOME variable contains the path to our home directory, and the PWD variable contains the path to our current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "echo $HOME\n",
    "## /Users/happyrabbit\n",
    "\n",
    "echo $PWD\n",
    "##/Users/happyrabbit/Documents/GitHub/Unix/files\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want one of our functions to be available always as a command then we need to change the PATH variable. Let’s take a look at this variable first.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "echo $PATH\n",
    "## /Users/happyrabbit/miniconda3/bin:/Users/happyrabbit/anaconda/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin:/opt/X11/bin\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The PATH variable contains a sequence of paths on our computer separated by colons. When the shell starts it searches these paths for executable files, and then makes those executable commands available in our shell. One approach to making our scripts available is to add a directory to the PATH. Bash scripts in the directory that are executable can be used as commands. We need to modify PATH every time we start a shell, so we can ammend our `~/.bash_profileso` that our directory for executable scripts is always in the PATH. To modify an environmental variable we need to use the `export` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let’s create a new directory called `Commands` in our Code directory where we can keep our executable scripts. Then we’ll add a line to our `~/.bash_profile` so that `Commands` is added to the PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "mkdir Commands\n",
    "nano ~/.bash_profile\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following code to the end of `.bash_profile`:\n",
    "\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "# set path for script\n",
    "export PATH=\"/Users/happyrabbit/Documents/GitHub/Unix/files/Commands:$PATH\"\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Save `~/.bash_profile` and close `nano`.  Now let’s source our Bash profile (we only need to do this once) and move `short` into the `Commands` directory. Then we should be able to use short as a command!\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "source ~/.bash_profile\n",
    "short\n",
    "## a baby  program\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "It works!\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively to making individual scripts executable we can add a source command to our `~/.bash_profile` so that we can use a Bash function on the command line. Let’s use nano to open up our ~/.bash_profile again.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "nano ~/.bash_profile\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following code to the end:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "source /Users/happyrabbit/Documents/GitHub/Unix/files/addseq2.sh\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the `~/.bash_profile`, quit `nano`, and now let’s source our `~/.bash_profile` so we can test if we can use `addseq2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "source ~/.bash_profile\n",
    "addseq2 9 1 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Again it works! If you have multiple Bash functions that you’d like to be able to use on the command line then it’s a good idea to define these functions in one of a few files so that you don’t have to source every individual function that you want to have available.\n",
