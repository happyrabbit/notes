# Learn Unix

This is my [learning notes on Unix](http://scientistcafe.com/notes/Unix/). It is initially from [Sean Kross](https://github.com/seankross)’ Coursera course “The Unix Workbench.” He has a [book](http://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench) with the same name. I will be adding material while I learn. The notes here only includes topics that I was not familiar with, or I want to understand in more detail.

Thank you, Sean Kross, for getting me started with learning Unix systematically!
