    "- All Bash programs have an exit status. True has an exit status of 0 and false has an exit status of 1\n",

    "- Conditional expressions are always in double brackets (`[[ ]]`). They have an exit status 0 if they contain a true assertion or 1 if they contain a false assertion.\n",
    "- IF statements evaluate conditional expressions. If an expression is true then the code within an IF statement is executed, otherwise it is skipped.\n",
    "- ELIF and ELSE statements also help control the flow of a Bash program, and IF statements can be nested within other IF statements."
