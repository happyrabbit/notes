    "Loops are one of the most important programming structures in the Bash language. All of the programs we've written so far are executed from the first line of the script until the last line, but loops allow you to repeat lines of code based on logical conditions or by following a sequence. The first kind of loop that we'll discuss is a FOR loop. **FOR loops** iterate through every element of a sequence that you specify. Let't take a look at a small example FOR loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "# File: forloop.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"Before Loop\"\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in {1..3}\n",
    "do\n",
    "  echo \"i is equal to $i\"\n",
    "done\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"After Loop\"\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at this example with several other kinds of sequence generating strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "# File: manyloops.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"Explicit list:\"\n",
    "\n",
    "for picture in img001.jpg img002.jpg img451.jpg\n",
    "do \n",
    "  echo \"picture is equal to $picture\"\n",
    "done\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"\"\n",
    "echo \"Array:\"\n",
    "\n",
    "stooges=(curly larry moe)\n",

    "1. typing out an explicit list\n",

    "  echo \"count is equal to $count\"\n",
    "  let count=$count-1\n",
    "done\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the logical expression is never equivalent to false then we've created an infinite loop, so the loop never ends and the program runs forever. It is undesirable. Here is an example of infinite loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "# File: foreverloop.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "count=3\n",
    "\n",
    "while [[ $count -gt 2 ]]\n",

    "- Loops allows you repeat sections of your program.\n",
    "- FOR loops iterate through a sequence so that a variable that you assign takes on the value of every element of the sequence in every iteration of the loop.\n",
    "- WHILE loops check a conditional statement at the beginning of every iteration. If the condition is equivalent to true then one iteration of the loop is executed and then the conditional statement is checked again. Otherwise the loop ends.\n",
